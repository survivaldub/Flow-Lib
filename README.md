## Features

### Authentication

EML Lib supports multiple authentication methods, including Microsoft, Azuriom, Yggdrasil and Crack. This allows you to choose the authentication method that best suits your needs and preferences.

_Read the docs for [MicrosoftAuth](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/microsoftauth), [YggdrasilAuth](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/yggdrasilauth), [AzAuth](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/azuriomauth) and [CrackAuth](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/crackauth)._

### Launch settings

Choose the Minecraft version and loader that you want to launch. EML Lib supports all Minecraft versions, from Minecraft beta to the latest Minecraft snapshot, and all loaders, including Vanilla, Forge, NeoForge, Fabric and Quilt. MCP support is coming soon. <br/>
EML Lib also allows you to use _Profiles_, which are sets of settings (such as Minecraft version, loader, mods, etc.) that you can save and reuse later.

EML Lib can automatically download and install Java to ensure that you have the correct Java version for the Minecraft version you want to launch. It also supports custom Java paths if you prefer to use your own Java installation.

To use all the capacities of EML Lib, you should set up your [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool) website. It will allow you to use features such as news, bootstraps, maintenance, background, and more.

_Read the docs for [Profiles](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/profiles), [Launcher](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/launcher) and [Java](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/java)._

### Skin and cape management

EML Lib can allow your players to manage their skins and capes. It supports the official Miccrosoft skin and cape system, as well as custom skins and capes. Players can change their skins and capes directly from the launcher.

_Read the [docs](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/skin)._

### Bootstrap [^1]

_Bootstrap_ is a powerful feature that allows you to auto-update your launcher. It checks for updates on a specified URL and downloads and installs them automatically. This ensures that your launcher is always up to date with the latest features and bug fixes.

_Read the [docs](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/bootstrap)._

### Maintenance mode [^1]

_Maintenance_ mode is a feature that allows you to block the launcher during maintenance. When maintenance mode is enabled, users will see a message indicating that the launcher is under maintenance and will not be able to launch Minecraft until the maintenance is complete.

_Read the [docs](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/maintenance)._

### Customization [^1]

EML Lib allows you to customize the launcher with various features, including:

- **News**: Displaying news on the launcher.
- **Background**: Displaying a background image on the launcher.
- **Server status**: Displaying server information on the launcher.

_Read the docs for [News](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/news), [Background](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/background) and [ServerStatus](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/serverstatus)._

### Stats [^1]

_Stats_ is a feature that allows you to collect and send anonymized usage statistics to EML AdminTool. This helps you understand how users are interacting with your launcher and can help you improve the user experience.

_Read the [docs](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/stats)._

### Crash reports [^1]

_Crash reports_ is a feature that allows you to collect and send crash reports to EML AdminTool. This helps you understand what went wrong when the launcher crashes and can help you fix the issues.

_Read the [docs](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/api-reference/crash-reports)._

## Comparison with other solutions

There are already several Node.js libraries to launch Minecraft. Here is how EML Lib compares to the main ones.

| Solution                         | Language / License       | Actively maintained     | Auth                                 | Loaders                                 | Agnostic mode | Ecosystem                   |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| **EML Lib**                      | TypeScript / MIT         | Yes                     | Microsoft, Azuriom, Yggdrasil, Crack | Vanilla, Forge, NeoForge, Fabric, Quilt | Yes (v2.2.0+) | EML AdminTool, EML Template |

| **@xmcl packages** (Voxelum)     | TypeScript / MIT         | Yes                     | — (low-level toolkit)                | All                                     | Yes           | XMCL launcher               |

### Key difference

Most existing libraries focus on _launching_ Minecraft. EML Lib focuses on _guaranteeing that every player runs exactly the expected environment_ — from authentication to file integrity, Java installation, and modpack distribution.

This is especially useful for:

- private servers that distribute a specific modpack,
- heavily modded servers where client drift causes issues,
- controlled environments where manual client edits are not acceptable.

If you do not need a backend, use agnostic mode with a [hosted JSON modpack file](https://emlproject.com/resources/modpack-json-generator). If you want a full administration dashboard, pair EML Lib with [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool).

## Installation

### Software requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher: see [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/);
- Electron 23 or higher: please install it with `npm i electron` _if you use Microsoft Authentication_.

To get all the capacities of this Node.js library, you should set up your [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool) website! Without it, some features will be unavailable (such as News, Bootstrap, etc.).

### EML Lib installation

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org).

```bash
# Using npm
npm i eml-lib
```

`eml-lib` package includes TypeScript typings, so you don't need to install `@types/eml-lib`.

### Template

You can use the [EML Template](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-Template) to create a Minecraft launcher with EML Lib. It is an Electron application that uses EML Lib to launch Minecraft. It is a good starting point to create your own Minecraft launcher.

### Quick start

Quick start using the [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool):

```js
const EMLLib = require('eml-lib')

const launcher = new EMLLib.Launcher({
  url: 'https://at.emlproject.com', // Your EML AdminTool URL
  root: 'eml',
  account: new EMLLib.CrackAuth().auth('GoldFrite')
})

launcher.launch()
```

Please refer to the [docs](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-lib-and-launcher/getting-started/set-up-environment) for more information.
