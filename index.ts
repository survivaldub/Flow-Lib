 *
 * **Requirements:**
 * - Node.js 15.14.0 or higher: see [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/);
 * - Electron 15.0.0 or higher: please install it with `npm i electron` _if you use

 * [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool) website!
 * - If you don't want to set up EML AdminTool, you can use our [modpack generator](https://emlproject.pages.dev/resources/modpack-generator/)
 * to generate an EML Lib-compatible modpack.
