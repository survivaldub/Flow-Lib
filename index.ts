/**
 * ## Electron Minecraft Launcher Lib
 * ### A Node.js library to build your Minecraft launcher easily with Electron.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Requirements:**
 * - Node.js 18 or higher: see [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/);
 * - Electron 20 or higher _if you use Microsoft Authentication_: please install it with
 * `npm i electron`.
 *
 * **Recommandations:**
 * - Always use this library from the `main` process of Electron, and forward events to the
 * `renderer` process using IPC if needed.
 * - To get all the capacities of this Node.js library, you should set up your
 * [EML AdminTool](https://emlproject.com/docs/eml-admintool/system-requirements) instance!
 * - If you don't want to set up EML AdminTool, you can use our [modpack generator](https://emlproject.com/resources/modpack-json-generator/)
 * to generate an EML Lib-compatible modpack.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Basic usage example:
 * ```ts
 * import { app, BrowserWindow } from 'electron'
 * import { MicrosoftAuth, Launcher } from 'eml-lib'
 *
 * app.whenReady().then(start)
 *
 * async function start() {
 *   const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow()
 *
 *   // 1. Authenticate
 *   const account = await (new MicrosoftAuth(mainWindow)).auth()
 *
 *   // 2. Setup launcher
 *   const launcher = new Launcher({
 *     url: 'https://at.emlproject.com',
 *     root: 'goldfrite',
 *     account: account,
 *     memory: { min: 2048, max: 1024 },
 *   })
 *
 *   // 3. Launch
 *   await launcher.launch()
 * }
 * ```
